# MadLibs Java Project

This project is a simple Java application for generating a MadLibs story. It's part of the Learn Java course on Codecademy, designed to help beginners understand basic concepts such as variables, input handling, and string manipulation.

## Overview

The application prompts the user to enter various words (nouns, adjectives, a verb, etc.) and an integer. These inputs are then incorporated into a pre-defined story template, resulting in a personalized MadLibs story.

## Usage

To run the program, compile the Java file and then execute it:

```bash
javac MadLibs.java
java MadLibs
